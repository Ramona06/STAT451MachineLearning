## STAT451 Machine Learning ## 
#### This is the repo consists of all machine learning projects I did from the coursework back in my undergrad studying data science at _University of Wisconsin - Madison_.

From this class, I developed a solid understanding of machine learning concepts, including supervised learning models like _support vector machines_, _linear regression_, _logistic regression_, and _decision trees_, as well as unsupervised techniques such as _clustering_ and _dimensionality reduction_. I also gained experience with ensemble methods like _boosting_ and _bagging_, and learned essential practices such as _feature engineering_, _cross-validation_, and _hyperparameter tuning_. Using Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciKit-Learn, I applied these techniques to real-world datasets. 

In the end, I completed a final project focused on womenâ€™s healthcare, utilizing the models and methods I learned to deliver meaningful insights.
